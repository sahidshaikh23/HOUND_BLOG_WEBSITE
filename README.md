## Blogging Application
This is a full-stack Blogging application built using MERN stack by a team of 2. The application loads data from a MongoDB database and displays them using **_React and MUI_** ( front-end ), **_NodeJs and ExpressJS_** ( back-end ).

**Vercel link of our project**:  https://houndblog.netlify.app/
- **Note:**
  - The website may experience a delay in loading, especially if it has been inactive for a while. The backend is deployed in a free-tier environment, and due to inactivity, the server may take a few seconds to spin up. We appreciate your patience.
